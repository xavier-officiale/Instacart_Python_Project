# Objective

In this student project I pretended to be an analyst at Instacart, and my primary responsibility was to examine the customer database and their purchasing behaviors. Our main objective was to refine our marketing strategy, recognizing the need to target various customer segments effectively. The goal was to develop marketing campaigns tailored to different customer profiles and assess their impact on product sales. I conducted an initial data analysis and exploratory examination to provide insights and recommend segmentation strategies based on predefined criteria.
